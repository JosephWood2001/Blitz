A recreation of the card game Dutch Blitz

# How to connect to a game
To join a player who is hosting on the same network as you, enter the local ip of the machine the game is being hosted on

To join a player who is not hosting on the same network as you, the host will need to configue their network settings to port-forward their hosting machine on port 7777, and then the guest will need to enter the hosts public ip address and then click the join button

(The join local button is only for joining a game being hosted on the same machine as the guest)
